# Semantic-Aware Genetic Programming

Welcome to the repository for **Semantic-Aware Genetic Programming**! This is my final year project at the University of Exeter, supervised by Prof. Alberto Moraglio. This project explores the role of semantic diversity in Genetic Programming (GP) through innovative selection mechanisms, including static and adaptive semantic thresholds. The goal is to enhance the evolutionary process by balancing exploration and exploitation, achieving robust solutions to symbolic regression problems.

## Features

- **Selection Algorithms**:
  - Traditional GP Selection
  - Static Semantic-Aware Selection (SiS)
  - Adaptive Semantic-Aware Selection (ASiS)


- **Customisable Parameters**:
  - Population size, generations, crossover and mutation rates.
  - Tournament size and semantic threshold settings.

- **Diversity Analysis**:
  - Semantic and syntactic diversity tracking.
  - PCA-based visualisation of semantic space.

- **Symbolic Regression Problems**:
  - A suite of test problems with varying complexity, including polynomials and trigonometric functions.


## Usage

### Configuring Experiments
All experimental parameters are defined in `config.yaml`. Modify this file to set population size, number of generations, thresholds, and other parameters.

## Key Results
- **Adaptive Thresholds (ASiS):** Achieve higher hit rates and faster convergence for complex problems.
- **Semantic Diversity:** PCA visualisations highlight improved exploration with semantic-aware methods.

Contributions are welcome! Please submit issues or pull requests to enhance the project.
